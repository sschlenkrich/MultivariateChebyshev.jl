# Multivariate Chebyshev

This package contains code for approximating multivariate functions using Chebyshev interpolation.

Details on the methodology are discussed in this [paper](ttps://ssrn.com/abstract=4155914).

For examples how to use the package you can have a look into the [tests code](https://github.com/sschlenkrich/MultivariateChebyshev.jl/blob/main/test/chebychev.jl).
